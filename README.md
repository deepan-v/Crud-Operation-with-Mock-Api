CRUD Operations with React:

Overview:
  This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The main purpose 
  of this project is to allow users to interact with a mock API, performing various operations on the data such as creating new entries,
  updating existing ones, deleting entries, and reading/displaying the data.

Features:
    Create: Users can add new entries to the mock API.
    Read: Display the data from the mock API for users to view.
    Update: Users can modify existing entries in the mock API.
    Delete: Remove entries from the mock API.
    Asynchronous Operations: Asynchronous operations are handled using the axios library, making the application more responsive.
    
Technologies Used:
      HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Basic web technologies for building the frontend.
      React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
      axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous requests.
